/* ========================================
   RESPONSIVE DESIGN - DEPRECATED
   NOTE: All responsive styles now integrated into css/style.css
   This file is kept for backward compatibility but is no longer needed.
   
   DO NOT USE THIS FILE - All media queries are defined in style.css
   with proper mobile-first cascade and no !important conflicts.
   ======================================== */

/* DEPRECATED: All responsive media queries have been consolidated into style.css
   to eliminate conflicts and ensure proper cascade behavior.
   
   Breakpoints now handled in style.css:
   - 320px (Extra Small)
   - 375px (Small Phones)
   - 481px (Medium Phones)
   - 601px (Small Tablets)
   - 769px (Medium Tablets)
   - 901px (Large Tablets)
   - 1025px (Small Desktops)
   - 1201px (Medium Desktops)
   - 1401px (Large Desktops)
   - 1601px (Extra Large)
   - 1921px+ (Ultra Large)
   
   This empty file is kept to prevent build errors if referenced elsewhere.
   Loading style.css alone provides all responsive functionality.
